  <p class="intro">
    Although the traditionally frothy romantic comedies are an easy way to chase away the Sunday scaries, there's nothing more warm and fuzzy than a solid musical movie, complete with singalongs and high-energy dance numbers. Who doesn’t like feeling like the world is capable of bursting into song at any moment? Ever since Judy Garland sang sweetly about returning home in The Wizard of Oz, fans have been hooked. These days, musical movies can sometimes be hit or miss: For as many crazy, joyful, ridiculous-in-the-best-way films like Mamma Mia (don't worry, it's on here) that exist in the world, there's...whatever Cats was (definitely not on the list). But when it's good, it's spectacular. Modern artists have taken the form and played with it, so it doesn't necessarily have to sound and look like a play come to life. That's especially true of the past few years, which have seen icons including Lin-Manuel Miranda giving us some of their best work. From the most classic musicals to underrated gems you may not have heard of, this list has just about everything you could want as a musical fan. Here are 50 iconic musicals spanning more than eight decades that are not to miss, featuring the most epic duets, dance sequences, and jazz hands of all time.

We catch a glimpse of a multitude of singers and groups with killer harmonies, and the music celebrates that love and energy. There's a reason this spawned two (not as good) sequels.</p>

And if you're familiar with the musical, there are some additions and updates—including a new song.</p>

Undeterred, he pushes on with the help of mentor Loco Chanelle (Richard E. Grant). The choreographed song and dance numbers, with Jamie becoming Mimi Me and finding his true self, are gorgeous.

        <p class="card-text">It's not just a meme: This strange, surreal, over-the-top movie also features a number of catchy songs. Gene Wilder has never been better as the wacky and kind of sadistic chocolate factory owner, and the songs about each selfish kid's nasty demise are beyond catchy.

        <h4 class="card-title">White Christmas (1954) </h4>
        <p class="card-text">This film popularized the version of "White Christmas" everyone knows, but it's also got a bunch more catchy, underrated tunes and not one but two romances. It was the highest-grossing musical ever at the time, and even though it's now very vintage, it makes for essential viewing during the cold weather.

        <h4 class="card-title">Cinderella (1997) </h4>
        <p class="card-text">The classic story of Cinderella and her glass slipper has been told countless times throughout pop culture, but it's not a stretch by any means to say that the 1997 musical film is the single most important iteration of the fairytale ever. Starring Brandy as our heroine and Whitney Houston as her fairy godmother, Cinderella features one of the most diverse casts on the silver screen and marked the first time that little black girls everywhere were able to see themselves as princesses too.</p>

        <p class="card-text">If you're going to watch one biopic, have it be the glorious celebration of Elton John's ascendancy as global pop phenomenon. It's an honest look at the darker parts of fame, including the singer's struggles with substance abuse. But it's also got all the songs you know and love (as well as the story of how John came to write and perform them).</p>

        <h4 class="card-title">Purple Rain (1984)</h4>
        <p class="card-text">Speaking of musical legends and their greatest hits...Prince stars in a movie loosely based on his life, in which The Kid escapes a bad home life through music. It's basically a vehicle for Prince to play songs like "Purple Rain" and "When Doves Cry," and it's a lasting testament to the late legend.

          A coming-of-age tale of a boy who forms a band to impress a girl...and then the band ends up being really, really good. It features remakes of classic songs from Sing Street, Hall & Oates, The Cure, and Duran Duran, as well as some gloriously OTT '80s fashion. What's not to love?

        <p class="card-text">  A retooling of the beloved Henson characters (and an Oscar winner for Best Original Song) this stars Amy Adams and Jason Segal as the human counterparts to their fuzzy costars. Muppet fan (and Muppet himself) Walter must help Kermit & co. from the evil Tex Richman. Will they get the band back together and save Muppet Theater? Obviously, yes, but it's super-fun getting there.

        <p class="card-text">  But you can't get much better than the classic. There are many good Muppets musicals, including their take on A Christmas Carol, but come on! This one has Kermit the Frog singing the original "Rainbow Connection"! The characters' origin stories! Adventures in Hollywood! It's somehow stuffed with characters, yet perfectly balanced.

        <p class="card-text">   A movie, based on a musical, based on a bunch of songs by The Proclaimers. This is the sweet story of two veterans who go home and deal with familial and romantic entanglements. An early vehicle for George Mackay (1917), the film's tender at its core and filled with talented people. Just wait until the characters get to their rendition of "I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles)."

        <h4 class="card-title">Fame (1980)</h4>
        <p class="card-text">  Following students in their time at the High School of Performing Arts in pursuit of—you guessed it—fame, the musical became a smash hit and a cult classic. It didn't shy away from depicting the trials and tribulations of success (and trying to make it in show biz), but the upbeat songs and gorgeous dance sequences are what make this film sing, pun intended.

        <h4 class="card-title"> 8 Women (2002)</h4>
        <p class="card-text">  Is this film completely ridiculous? Absolutely, but it's also a who's who of iconic French actresses having a ball in a twist on the classic murder mystery. The patriarch of a family is found dead, and one of eight women must have done it. Then it turns into a musical with a bunch of super-catchy songs.

        <p class="card-text">   A street musician and a Czech immigrant make an unlikely pair in this indie-film-that-could, which nabbed several Oscars and launched a Broadway musical run. You won't find any overproduction or jazz hands in this sparse film, but the musical arrangements from Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova are gorgeous, and worth listening to in surround-sound.

The most beautiful courtesan at the Moulin Rouge dancehall (played by Nicole Kidman) and a poor writer (Ewan McGregor) fall in love but have to keep their romance a secret or risk shutting down the cabaret.

It's the rare sequel that might be better than the original.

          Taking its inspiration from the story of P. T. Barnum's creation of the circus and the lives of its star attractions, The Greatest Showman is truly a work of art. The songs are catchy earworms, enough to look past the many artistic licenses they take with Barnum's history. Try not to cry when Keala Settle sings "This Is Me," I dare you.

          The fourth (and arguably the best) remake of the 1937 film is co-written and directed by Bradley Cooper and stars none other than Lady Gaga. It's about a hard-drinking musician (Cooper) who discovers and falls in love with a young singer (Gaga), and her rise to stardom. Gaga is a force in this film, delivering a performance that will break your heart. This is not the most "light-hearted" fare, relative to others on this list, but the music is good enough to look past that. Check out content warnings beforehand if you don't know the plot.

          This movie is part homage, part parody. Giselle (Amy Adams) is a Disney Princess who is ejected from the animated land of Andalasia into the live-action world of New York City, and, let us tell you, shenanigans ensue. Adams has some unexpectedly great singing chops, and James Marsden is a true joy as a narcissistic, self-absorbed prince vying for Giselle's heart. Alan Menken and Stephen Schwartz's soundtrack is the best part.

          Nothing but love and respect for the first Sister Act (1992), but the sequel might be one of the best musical films of all time. Whoopi Goldberg reprises her role as lounge singer turned nun Sister Mary Clarence, this time helping St. Francis Academy stay open by turning her class of rowdy teenagers into a legit show choir, and a young Lauryn Hill also stars in the film as a moody student with powerhouse vocals. Let's not forget about the choir's incredible remix of "Joyful, Joyful," which, honestly is the most lit rendition of the Christmas class ever to be made.

The Disney musical follows the journey of a popular jock who finds his love and his voice, much to the displeasure of his friends and family. HSM was so successfully that it spawned two sequels as well as a number of spinoffs. And yes, we still know the choreography to "We're All in This Together."  </p>
