<!-- Introduction: What is the essential story being told by your site and what type of structure
did you choose to implement? -->
The structure I have chosen to implement for my website is the hierarchical structure. Since I had different articles of different categories, designing my site around a single homepage allowed for the easy navigation of my website. The story that is being told by my website by using this structure is that there is more to film and TV than just the plot itself. By having articles with regards to recipes from movies and clothes from TV, I am able to show that there is something that movies and TV has to offer everyone.

<!-- State 3 things that have inspired you when creating your website. These could include
guest speakers, other websites, artists, developers etc.  -->
https://theglossarymagazine.com/ is the first website that inspired me in the making of my website. I liked the layout of this particular website very much as it was more picture-centric rather than focused on text. In particular, the fashion page of my website was inspired by Glossary Magazine’s website as the article had more images than text. By following a similar layout, I believe I have made my website more attractive to a user.
https://www.vogue.in/?international is the second website that inspired me in the making of my website. I liked the very simple colour palette of the website in the sense that it was mainly black and white. I felt that by not having an extravagant colour scheme, the Vogue website was able to divert the user’s attention to the actual articles instead of the styling of the website itself. Therefore, I too used a very basic colour palette to keep the focus of the user on the article.
https://www.harpersbazaar.com/ is the third website that inspired me in the making of my website. As compared to other websites, Harper’s Bazaar’s website’s navigation bar was simple but functional. I liked the simplicity of the bar as it did not take away the attention from the main article of the page. Thus, I too decided to use a simple navigation bar to keep the focus of my website on the articles. I also felt a simple navigation bar was more befitting of my website’s minimalistic aesthetic.


<!-- State 3 ways in which your site is accessible. -->
Since some of the articles I used in my website are really long, I have implemented a “Back To Top” button which upon clicking, would bring the user back to the top of the webpage. This allows for users (with mobility issues perhaps) to easily scroll back to the top without having to actually scroll back all the way.
I have used a very basic black and white colour scheme in order for my website to be accessible to any user who might have slightly impaired vision or colour blindness.
The alt attribute for the images is used to make my website more accessible for when the user might use a screen reader when accessing my website.

<!-- State 3 ways in which you have considered usability in your site. -->
My website is usable in the sense that I have made it responsive for different screen sizes. This allows for my users to access my website on virtually any device.
I have created a consistent layout and design throughout my website to keep the website’s users’ minds at ease. By making my website’s design consistent, I am able to make it look coherent and work harmoniously across the different pages and elements.
I have restricted the use of text on my homepage and used more images in order to attract users. This makes my website more usable since users will not be turned away by the abundance of text on the homepage.

<!-- State 3 things you had to learn/find out by yourself when creating your site, and describe how you did that (i.e. what searches you did, any new tools/techniques you learned, any changes/adaptations you made to a particular resource to make it work with your site). -->
The carousel on my homepage was not working properly at first. As I implemented more elements to my homepage, the layout got messed up and the carousel stopped working. The pagination indicator was not right below the carousel as it was supposed to be. Instead, it got moved all the way to the bottom of the page, near the footer. The troubleshooting that I did for the carousel to work correctly on my homepage was something I had to do on my own as a simple online search would not help me resolve the issue.
The overlay on the index.html carousel was something that did not work properly initially too. Since I had referred to the W3C website for the code for this part of the carousel, I had to modify the CSS attributes to the HTML carousel element in order to suit my website’s layout. I had to experiment with the different CSS elements for the overlay in order to find out the attribute that best suited my website.
For my fashion.html page, some of the images were extending out to the right side, overshooting the length of the navigation bar. Therefore, I had to use the overflow-x property to troubleshoot this problem. However, it did not work initially. I then had to put the overflow-x property under both the html and the body. I solved this problem by looking it up on Stack Overflow.

<!-- What aspect(s) of your work do you think worked well and why? -->
I think the colour scheme of my website worked really well. I had initially chosen to use a pastel blue and pink colour scheme and then decided to change it to a black and white one to keep the website simple yet attractive and usable. I think this worked well because my website used a lot of images and videos and a black and white scheme was the only colour scheme that would suit all the images and videos.
I also think the homepage of my website is really good as it is neat and does not have too many words apart from the title of the articles. I feel like this would attract more users to stay on my website as the images are attractive and there are not many words to turn the users away.

<!-- What aspect(s) of your work could be improved, and how might you do things differently another time? -->
I feel like if I worked on this project again, I would make my website look even more sophisticated. Even though I do like how my website has turned out, I do feel like it does not look as professional as the websites I had quoted as my inspiration. I also think I could have segregated my time wisely instead of focusing too much on just one page.

<!-- What resources were used when creating your work? You should list here any sources of information, libraries, plug-ins or other code that you used to create your site. You should
also reference any code you've used by inserting comments at the start of the scripts. -->
